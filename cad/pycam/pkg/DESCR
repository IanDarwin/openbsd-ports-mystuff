PyCAM is a toolpath generator for 3-axis CNC machining. It loads 3D models in
STL format or 2D contour models from DXF or SVG files. The resulting G-Code can
be used with any machine controller that supports gcode.

PyCAM supports a wide range of toolpath strategies for 3D models and 2D contour
models.

Sam is a very small Text-To-Speech (TTS) program written in C, that runs on most
popular platforms. It is an adaption to C of the speech software SAM (Software
Automatic Mouth) for the Commodore C64 published in the year 1982 by Don't Ask
Software (now SoftVoice, Inc.). It includes a Text-To-Phoneme converter called
reciter and a Phoneme-To-Speech routine for the final output. It is so small
that it will work also on embedded computers. On my computer it takes less than
39KB (much smaller on embedded devices as the executable-overhead is not
necessary) of disk space and is a fully stand alone program. For immediate
output it uses the SDL-library, otherwise it can save .wav files.

The busybeed OpenBSD daemon provides a mechanism for clients and client
processes to communicate with an array of serial and IoT devices. At
its core, busybeed is primarily a packet repeater in that it polls for
packets to swap between subscriber clients and devices. However,
busybeed also provides password control over those connections,
including client limits.

The thingsd OpenBSD proxy daemon provides a mechanism for clients and client
processes to communicate with an array of serial and IoT things. At its core,
thingsd is primarily a packet repeater in that it waits for packets to swap
between subscriber clients and things. However, thingsd also provides password
control over those connections, including client limits.

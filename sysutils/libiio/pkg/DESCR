libiio is used to interface to the Linux Industrial Input/Output (IIO)
Subsystem. The Linux IIO subsystem is intended to provide support for devices
that in some sense are analog to digital or digital to analog converters (ADCs,
DACs). This includes, but is not limited to ADCs, Accelerometers, Gyros, IMUs,
Capacitance to Digital Converters (CDCs), Pressure Sensors, Color, Light and
Proximity Sensors, Temperature Sensors, Magnetometers, DACs, DDS (Direct Digital
Synthesis), PLLs (Phase Locked Loops), Variable/Programmable Gain Amplifiers
(VGA, PGA), and RF transceivers. You can use libiio natively on an embedded
Linux target (local mode), or use libiio to communicate remotely to that same
target from a host Linux, Windows or MAC over USB or Ethernet or Serial.

Although libiio was primarily developed by Analog Devices Inc., it is an active
open source library, which many people have contributed to. The library is
released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1 or (at
your option) any later version, this open-source license allows anyone to use
the library, on any vendors processor/FPGA/SoC, which may be controlling any
vendors peripheral device (ADC, DAC, etc) either locally or remotely. This
includes closed or open-source, commercial or non-commercial applications
(subject to the LGPL license freedoms, obligations and restrictions). The
examples and test applications (sometimes referred to as the iio-utils) are
released separately under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.0 (at
your option) any later version.
